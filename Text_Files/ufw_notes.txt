## UFW
- short for uncomplicated firewalls
- easier compared to iptables
- UFW runs on top of iptables
- streamlined process
- sudo mst be used for using any of the commands

## installing
$ sudo apt install ufw -y

## checking status
$ sudo ufw status
$ sudo ufw status verbose
$ sudo ufw status numbered

## enable/disable
$ sudo ufw enable
    - denys devices access to localhost but allows localhost to interact with others
$ sudo ufw disable

## blocking ip addresses
$ sudo ufw deny from <ip address>

## blocking subnets
$ sudo ufw deny from <ip address>/<subnet>
$ sudo ufw deny from 192.168.1.0/24
    - denys anyone from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255
$ sudo ufw deny from 192.168.1.250/24
    - denys anyone from 192.168.1.250 to 192.168.1.255


## blocking an interface
$ sudo ufw deny in on <interface> from <ip address>
$ sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from 192.168.0.20
    - denys 192.168.0.20 access to localhost from ethernet

## blocking a port
$ sudo ufw deny in from <ip address> to any port <port number>
$ sudo ufw deny in from 192.168.0.200 to any port 22/tcp
$ sudo ufw deny <start of port range>:<end of port range>/<port protocol>
$ sudo ufw deny 2000:3000/tcp
    - adds an ipv4 rule as well as a ipv6 rule

## allow a connection
- replace deny with allow
$ sudo ufw allow from <ip address>
$ sudo ufw allow from <ip address>/<subnet>
$ sudo ufw allow in on <interface> from <ip address>

## delete a rule
$ sudo ufw delete <rule number>
$ sudo ufw delete 1
    - deletes the first rule on my ufw rules as long as you enter "y" when it asks if you want to

## profile
- pretty common for most network set-ups
- there are IT profiles, salesforce profiels, etc ...
$ sudo ufw app list
    - lists all the application profiles on your device
$ sudo ufw allow <profile name>
$ sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
